Conteúdo da seção Sobre mim: {
  Hello, I'm Bruno Tenório, originally from Itaquaquecetuba, in the east zone of São Paulo. In 2010, at the age of 13, I delved into programming by creating my first server for the game Fatality Gunz, even without prior knowledge of c++, databases, php, or protocols. I was confident that it was possible to learn and master what I loved. In 2020, I started courses at Alura, focusing on front-end development. Currently, I am honing my skills in both front and back-end, aiming to work in a cutting-edge technology company where I can grow professionally and continue learning.
